- need to set a network ip range

-concerning mariadb bind-address:
"If you want other containers (such as a WordPress or NGINX container) to be able to connect to the MariaDB container, you will need to set bind-address to the IP address of the Docker network interface that the containers are connected to. Typically, this will be the IP address of the Docker network gateway, which is usually 172.17.0.1 by default.

So, if you want to allow connections from other containers on the Docker network, you would need to set the bind-address in 50-server.cnf to 172.17.0.1 (or the IP address of your Docker network gateway if it is different).
-The localhost parameter in the CREATE USER instruction specifies the hostname or IP address that the user can connect from, but when running MariaDB inside a Docker container, this is typically set to localhost or 127.0.0.1 because the user will be connecting from inside the same container as the MariaDB server. However, if you want to allow users from other containers to connect to MariaDB, you would need to create a user with a hostname or IP address that matches the IP address of the Docker network interface that the other containers are connected to."

-manipulate databases
-concerning 50-server.cnf config file (especially bind address)
-If you want to allow other containers on the same Docker network to access the MariaDB server, you should set bind-address to the IP address of the Docker network interface, which is typically in the range 172.17.0.0/16. For example, you could set bind-address to 172.17.0.2 if that is the IP address of the Docker container running the MariaDB server. This would allow other containers on the same Docker network to access the MariaDB server using that IP address.

*internet <=> Back-end infrastructure 
*event driven architecture
*Reverse proxy: Distribute the load to multiple back-end servers (+security, caching, SSL(TLS) encryption)
*using Linux server (conf file in /etc)
*customize the server by defining directives (key-value pair, or inside  {} => context)
*one of Nginx roles is to serve static content like images and HTML files 
*define server directives where you can specify which ports to listen to 
*directive of "Location" of where to find the raw files 
*include SSL configuration
