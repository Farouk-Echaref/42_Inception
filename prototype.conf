     #serving different types of content (Content-Type): Approach One:
     type {
        text/css    css;
        text/html   html;
     }
     #Approach two: Mime.types has all the possible content,

        # access this with : localhost:8080
        root /Users/fech-cha/Desktop/42_Inception; #look for the index.html(supposing index.html is inside the 42_inception)

        #serving different content on a different path : access this with localhost:8080/Folder
        #appends /Folder at the end of the root path
        location /Folder {
            root /Users/fech-cha/Desktop/42_Inception;

        #making alias to show same page as in Folder
        #example: localhost:8080/Folder2 should show the ame as localhost:8080/Folder
        location /Folder2{
            alias /Users/fech-cha/Desktop/42_Inception/Folder;
        }

        #by default the webserve looks for index.html, in case you want to try a diffrent file:
        location /Folder3 {
            root /Users/fech-cha/Desktop/42_Inception;

            #it looks for the specified file, if not found, serve the index in the root, if not found throw 404 Error
            try_files /Folder3/fold.html /index.html = 404;
        }

        #come back to this
        rewrite ^/number/(\w+) /count/$1

        #use regex (regular expressions)
        #matches any (case-insensitive) request in the next location block that contains a number between 0 to 9
        #example: localhost:8080/count/4 , or localhost:8080/count/2 , etc .. will redirect to the index localhost:8080
        location ~* /count/[0-9] {
            root /Users/fech-cha/Desktop/42_Inception;
            try_files /index.html = 404;
        }

        #redirecting to another path
        #example if i searched localhost:8080/FolderX, i get localhost:8080/Folder
        location /FolderX {
            return 307 /Folder; (307 is a HTTP Code for Redirection)
        }
